## [Obsidian-Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)

A task manager plugin.

- To tag a line item as a task, mark with the global task filter (defined in the settings) tag
    - I've set mine to #todo
- To view all tasks tagged in the vault, open a new document and type

    > \```todo
    > 
    > \```
