### Set-up to allow remote editing using Sublime Text 3
Install [RemoteSubl](https://github.com/randy3k/RemoteSubl) and follow all instructions in the README. In particular
* `mv /usr/local/bin/rmate /usr/local/bin/rsubl` to give command a more intuitive name
* Add to SSH config in `~/.ssh/config`
	```
	Host myremote
		HostName HOSTNAME
		RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698
		User USERNAME
	```
	so that connection is as simple as `ssh myremote`

### Things to add to user preferences
* Put these in the `Preferences.sublime-settings--User` file found in Preferences > Settings (or by pressing Command + ,)
```json
{
	"font_size": 14,
	"translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
}
```
